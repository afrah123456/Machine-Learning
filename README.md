Loan Status Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using machine learning models. By analyzing applicant data, the model determines whether a loan application should be approved or rejected. The project uses various features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more to train and evaluate the model's performance.

Machine Learning Model
The primary machine learning model used for this project is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is an effective classification model that helps identify decision boundaries for distinguishing eligible and ineligible applicants. Additionally, other models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting can also be explored to further enhance the prediction accuracy.

Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on their attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more. The project leverages machine learning techniques to estimate insurance premiums, assisting insurers and policyholders in understanding cost factors.

Machine Learning Model
The project employs Linear Regression as the primary algorithm to predict medical insurance costs. Linear Regression effectively models the relationship between the predictor variables and the insurance premium. For further improvements in prediction accuracy, advanced techniques such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, or tree-based algorithms like Random Forests and XGBoost can also be considered.
